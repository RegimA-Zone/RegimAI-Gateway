# RegimAI Gateway - Cognitive Architecture Implementation

## üöÄ Overview

The RegimAI Gateway is an AI Gateway specifically designed for dermatology and skincare cognitive services. It adapts the traditional AI Gateway pattern to provide unified access to AI models, agents, and tools while maintaining domain expertise in skincare and dermatology.

Built on the SkinTwin cognitive architecture, it combines the power of AtomSpace, PLN reasoning, MOSES pattern mining, and ESN temporal prediction with modern AI services to create an intelligent gateway for healthcare applications.
