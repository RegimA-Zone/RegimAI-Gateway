I've significantly enhanced the VM-daemon skills system with comprehensive SkinTwin-specific patterns and templates. Here's what I added:

New Skill Templates

1. **OpenCog AtomSpace**: For knowledge representation operations
2. **PLN Reasoning**: For probabilistic logic networks and reasoning rules
3. **ECAN Attention**: For attention allocation and resource management
4. **Dermatological Knowledge**: For medical domain concepts and relationships
5. **Bridge Communication**: For Elisp-C++ integration patterns
6. **Cognitive Processing**: For cognitive architecture workflows (SCAN, SPIN, SENS, SEVO)

Advanced Analysis Engine

Created a comprehensive analysis system () that:

- Detects OpenCog-specific patterns in C++ code
- Identifies dermatological concepts and relationships
- Recognizes cognitive processing workflows
- Analyzes bridge communication patterns
- Extracts medical knowledge structures

Context-Aware Skill Generation

The system now intelligently determines the most appropriate skill type based on:

- File path and extension
- Content analysis
- OpenCog library usage
- Medical domain indicators
- Cognitive architecture patterns

Enhanced Workflow Integration

Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to use the new analysis engine, providing richer skill generation that understands your SkinTwin project's unique hybrid architecture.

Documentation and Guidance

Added comprehensive documentation for developers on how to use the generated skills effectively within the SkinTwin context.

The system will now automatically generate Copilot skills that understand your OpenCog components, medical domain knowledge, Elisp integration, and cognitive architecture patterns, making development more efficient and consistent across your complex hybrid system.
